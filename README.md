# Honeycomb TV Tech Test


##### Challenge

```Provide a means of defining and applying various discounts to the cost of delivering material to broadcasters, the solution to be flexible.```

### My Approach

The brief for the tech test seemed a little ambiguous in the beginning as I was unsure whether I was supposed to build off of the already written code, or build my own platform and then implement the specified functionality.

I decided to rebuild the platform, upon completion of my solution I realised this was not what was required of us, but it was obviously very similar so I decided to leave mine how it was rather than try to extract it into the original codebase.

### How to run

I have split the examples into two separate files, `run.rb` and `run_two.rb`. I retained the output code from the original codebase example so everything will look the same.
